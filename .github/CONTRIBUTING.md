# Contributing

Looking to contribute to the TreeWeb codebase? You've come to the right place! We welcome pull requests, issues, feedback, etc., and have a few guidelines for contributions:

### When Contributing

- **Include tests that test the range of behavior that changes.**
- Update any associated documentation affected by your change.
- Ensure your pull request description accurately describes the changes you are proposing. See [short reason](https://twitter.com/dzaporozhets/status/870268536404533249) and [long reason](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/how-square-writes-commit-messages-8e92fcbf77c9).
- If your PR fixes a bug, make sure the issue includes clear steps to reproduce the bug so the fix can be easily tested.
- Increment package.json version (used to automatically tag a new release).
